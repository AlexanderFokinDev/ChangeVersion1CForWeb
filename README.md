## Description
If you have updated the 1C platform version and you have an web service IIS with some published 1C services, then each of them must be updated manually from the 1C enterprise studio.
But instead you can run this application. It needs an info about previous and current versions of the 1C platform. The application will update all services automatically.

## Example of a launch command:
>\\RUSPRFS005.company.local\TradeData\ChangeVersion1CForWeb\bin\ChangeVersion1CForWeb 8.3.18.1741 8.3.18.1289
